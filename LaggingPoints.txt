3.when you want to find the way to insert the records into the table below key points are matters
	1.To have better understanding of relationship between the table look at ER diagram 
	2.To findout what are the table this current table depand on Ex : Production.Product
		i.Need to search it in through the SSMS right click on the table you will see in the general section
			i.object depands on the product 
			ii.product depands on the object
		ii.in the second option is need for our case when you want to insert the data into product check the object which our product depand on 
		iii.Or Go to the table definition and you can look for the foreign key 
			I.ALTER TABLE [Production].[Product]  WITH CHECK ADD  CONSTRAINT [FK_Product_ProductSubcategory_ProductSubcategoryID] FOREIGN KEY([ProductSubcategoryID])
													REFERENCES [Production].[ProductSubcategory] ([ProductSubcategoryID])
			II.FK_Product_ProductSubcategory_ProductSubcategoryID : which says ProductSubcategory table in that table we have product subcategoryID coulmn which is the primary key
				in that table that is being (REFERENCES [Production].[ProductSubcategory] ([ProductSubcategoryID]) refernced as foreign key in the product table
			III.Thus when you want to insert the values into the prouduct table you should have the ProductSubcategoryID otherwise you can't
		iv.what is objects depands on the product : which means when the in the product table the depandent table purchaseOrderDetails must not have the product
			Data which say it might not been purchased so far . The table would not have table data .
				I.To findout that go the table definition and look for the foreign key :
					ALTER TABLE [Purchasing].[PurchaseOrderDetail]  WITH CHECK ADD  CONSTRAINT [FK_PurchaseOrderDetail_Product_ProductID] FOREIGN KEY([ProductID])
						REFERENCES [Production].[Product] ([ProductID])
						
				II.FK_PurchaseOrderDetail_Product_ProductID : Purchase order Details table has the coulmn productID refernced in the production  productID  primary coulmn
				
In a simpler term : for an example of EmployeeProfile table 
			i.If the employee table has an foreign key which is being referenced as primary key in other table like : Employee (EmployeeID)
				then EmployeeProfile depands on the Employee to get any data into the table. if record not there in the Employee table data won't be inserted EmployeeProfile
			ii.If the EmployeeProfile has been referenced in some other table as foreign key that table depands on EmployeeProfile for an example : EmployeeDetails (EmployeeProfileID)
